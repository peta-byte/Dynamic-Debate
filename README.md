# Dynamic Debate

This project was generated with [Angular CLI](https://github.com/angular/angular-cli) version 9.0.4.

Its main features are:

- Testing with Cypress: for UI interactivity & functionality testing.
- Messing with momentjs: for the debate's timer.


## Development server

Run `ng serve` for a dev server. Navigate to `http://localhost:4200/`. The app will automatically reload if you change any of the source files.


## Running Cypress tests

Open 2 terminals in the same project root folder.

1st terminal: Run `npm run start` to execute the app on http://localhost:4200.
2nd terminal: Run `npm run cypress:open` to start Cypress interactively and see the tests in action.
